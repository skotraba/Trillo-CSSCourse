#  CSS and Sass Design Course Project

To create this project I followed this course:
> [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/)

I'm using this course as a reference to look back at when I need to remember how to do specific stylings or good practices using CSS.

Some of the resources for this course can be found here:
